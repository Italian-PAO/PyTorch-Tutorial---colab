It is a define-by-run framework, which means that your backprop is\n","defined by how your code is run, and that every single iteration can be\n","different.\n","\n","Let us see this in more simple terms with some examples.\n","\n","Tensor\n","--------\n","\n","``torch.Tensor`` is the central class of the package. If you set its attribute\n","``.requires_grad`` as ``True``, it starts to track all operations on it. When\n","you finish your computation you can call ``.backward()`` and have all the\n","gradients computed automatically. The gradient for this tensor will be\n","accumulated into ``.grad`` attribute.\n","\n","To stop a tensor from tracking history, you can call ``.detach()`` to detach\n","it from the computation history, and to prevent future computation from being\n","tracked.\n","\n","To prevent tracking history (and using memory), you can also wrap the code block\n","in ``with torch.no_grad():``. This can be particularly helpful when evaluating a\n","model because the model may have trainable parameters with\n","``requires_grad=True``, but for which we don't need the gradients.\n","\n","There’s one more class which is very important for autograd\n","implementation - a ``Function``.\n","\n","``Tensor`` and ``Function`` are interconnected and build up an acyclic\n","graph, that encodes a complete history of computation.
